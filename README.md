# frescoPRC

frescoPRC is an input generator created to perform calculations based in the model presented in	PRC 94 6 (2016), 064605 for even and odd actinides (effective couplings between bands with dispersive corrections to the optical potential) with the nuclear reactions program FRESCO. Calculations based in that model only could be done using nuclear reactions program OPTMAN but now, using this tool, FRESCO's inputs consistent with that model can be generated. This tool was part of a master thesis presented in December 2018 and thanks to it several bugs in OPTMAN program were found and fixed. You can check the master thesis report (in spanish) here https://hdl.handle.net/11441/81662.

A detailed description of the tool's input can be found in the file frescoPRC_documentation.pdf. The tool's inputs used in the calculations presented in this file are included too as input_even.INP and input_odd.INP. A bash file runall.sh is included too in order to run all FRESCO's inputs generated by the tool.

Since the tool were created to be compatible with a modified version of FRESCO, ...
